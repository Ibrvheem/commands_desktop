        text: `
        Since inception in 1956, the statutory roles of the NN have expanded to cover the full spectrum of military, policing, and diplomatic functions. So also, were the imperatives of operational capacity that demand effective presence and domain awareness within the internal waters, territorial seas, and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). As part of the structural response to these challenges, the NN had over the past decades operated a two-command structure for the coordination of its operational level activities, namely; Western Naval Command (WNC) and Eastern Naval Command (ENC). while noting that both operational commands have equitably discharged their responsibilities, recent events and indeed the trend of threats within the nation's marital domain have justified the necessity for a review of the current structure. Specifically, the emergence of various forms of illegal trafficking, militancy, sabotage, piracy, and attacks on shipping have placed considerable demand on NN policing capacity, particularly in the Niger Delta. Inevitably, apart from improved coastal presence with ships and bases, there are emergent requirements for more robust capability on riverine and special operations, including the protection of Key Points and Valuable Points.
 \n       
        In consonance with the foregoing realities, the NN besides previous arguments for, and under its ongoing transformation process identified the need for the creation of a third operational command. Therefore, following the recent approval by the Navy Board, this Nigerian Navy Order hereby promulgates the establishment of the Third Operational Command to be known as the Central Naval Command (CNC).

                Naval doctrine provides the foundation upon which navies are organized, trained, equipped, and deployed. It also sets the basis for assessment and improvement of standards for personnel and equipment, hence the need for emplacement of doctrines for regular assessment of activities and procedures in the Nigerian Navy (NN). To achieve this, efforts were made in the past including the establishment of Naval Training Command, Directorate of Inspection Doctrine and Research, Sea Training Command, and Naval Doctrine and Assessment Centre (NDAC).
\n
                The structure and mandate of NDAC as a field unit showed inherent limitations that impede the center's effectiveness. It is, therefore, imperative for the NN to institute an enduring establishment to formulate and superintend over the implementation of principles, practices, techniques as well as procedures of naval operations, consistent with the NN Doctrine. Accordingly, Navy Board 4 of 2021 approved the establishment of a Doctrine Command with its headquarters to be located at NN's land in Epe, Lagos State, and to take over roles of NDAC, among other responsibilities. In order to give effect to the decision of the Navy Board, this NNO hereby promulgates the establishment of the Command and sets out its modus operandi. The Command shall be known as the Naval Doctrine Command (NAVDOC).

                Over the years, the Nigerian Navy (NN) has separated fleet support services from logistic support services to improve its operational efficiency. As a result, the administrative control of logistics is split between the Maintenance Corps (FMC) and the Logistic Corps. However, challenges in this arrangement have adversely affected the ability to provide adequate logistics support for naval operations. Other limitations of the current logistic system in the NN include a lack of a career profession for a body of well-trained logistics officers and a separation between maintenance and supply of spare parts.
\n
                In order to address these issues and ensure more practical and result-oriented fleet and logistic support for sustained naval operations, there is a need for the NN to adopt an integrated approach. Consequently, to have a functional and efficient response to the military challenges of an ever-expanding scope, the Logistics Command (NNLC) is hereby established. The task of the NNLC is to preserve, maintain, and sustain systems in a state of operational readiness and at minimum cost, consistent with mission requirements.

          BRIEF HISTORY OF NAVAL DOCTRINE COMMAND
      
          INTRODUCTION
          1. The Naval Doctrine Command (NAVDOC) was established on 5 Jan 22 as a more robust structure for the realization of the mandate earlier assigned to the defunct NDAC. The Command is currently in its third year of existence. It would be recalled that the Command began as Sea Training Unit (STU) in 1993 and was subsequently renamed Naval Doctrine and Assessment Centre (NDAC) on 7 Feb 12 before its upgrade. Prior to its upgrade to a Command, the defunct units operated under a unique organisational structure, which is at Directorate level. NAVDOC is tasked with formulation of doctrinal values which are critical to the operational and organisational objectives towards enhanced professionalism in the NN.
      
          2. The Command has been able to deliver considerably in some areas of its mandate such as human capacity development, infrastructural development and supporting the fleet renewal effort of the NN in line with the CNS Strategic Directives. Since the establishment of NAVDOC, efforts have been made to lay a solid foundation for optimal performance of its operational and administrative tasks. As such, the Command continued to execute its expanded statutory roles and other assigned tasks towards enhancing the operational efficiency of the NN.
      
          FUNCTIONS OF NAVAL DOCTRINE COMMAND
          3. The Command is a response to NN’s need for an enduring organisation to formulate and oversee careful implementation of concepts, principles, practices, techniques and procedures of naval operations, consistent with the NN Doctrine. The Command achieves this through actualization of several important functions, which include development of doctrines, conduct of work-up of NN fleet and acceptance trials of new acquisitions which aims at blending the ships' company and the equipment into an efficient and effective fighting unit as well as supporting fleet renewal efforts of the NN. The aspect of work-up was always realized through some forms of training that include: Safety Operational Sea Training (SOST), Basic Operational Sea Training (BOST) and Consolidated Operational Sea Training (COST), which involve the use of NN Evaluation Checklists before the conduct of drills, exercises and evolutions.
      
          NOTABLE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE COMMAND
          4. The Command’s major activities cover training of its personnel which is aimed at enhancing professional capacity towards accomplishment of assigned tasks, assessment of the conduct of Exercises such as OBANGAME EXPRESS, REMEX, CNS Sea Exercise among others. The Command has successfully conducted Command Appointment Examination (CAPEX) and Midshipman Board for Regular Combatant Cadets before commissioning. Furthermore, the Command has carried out curriculum review of NN professional schools and colleges in as well as conduct of the Higher Rates Professional Advancement Examinations for junior and senior rates amongst others.
      
          FLAG OFFICERS COMMANDING
          5. NAVDOC has so far been commanded by 2 Flag Officers Commanding, they are:
            a. Rear Admiral AN Ayafa (Jan 22 – Jun 23)
            b. Rear Admiral HD Zakaria (Jun 23 till date)

        The Eastern Naval Command (ENC) was established in 1971, with the Headquarters at Calabar. The Command is one of the 3 operations commands of the Nigerian Navy tasked with carrying out the Nigerian Navy’s statutory roles and other assigned duties both at peace and in war. Its Area of Responsibility stretches from    Longitude 007° 20”E to Longitude 008° 30’ 44”E. The Command has a coastline of about 110 nautical miles with 200 nautical miles Exclusive Economic Zone which extends into the Joint Development Zone with Equatorial Guinea and Sao Tome and Principe. 
        
        The Command’s maritime space is about 22,000 square nm. This area is host to several national economic assets which include 12 crude oil loading terminals, about 500 oil fields, 6 Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plants and 2 refineries. The area is also host to 3 major seaports, a rich fishery field and various industrial complexes lying across 9 major rivers interspersed with over 5,000 creeks and estuaries. On land, the ENC AOR covers 16 states from Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross River upward to Bauchi, Yobe and Borno States, including the Lake Chad. The ENC is strategically poised to protect national security and economic interests in its AOR

    //     text: "BRIEF HISTORY OF NAVAL DOCTRINE COMMAND INTRODUCTION 1.	The Naval Doctrine Command (NAVDOC) was established on 5 Jan 22 as a more robust structure for the realization of the mandate earlier assigned to the defunct NDAC. The Command is currently in its third year of existence. It would be recalled that the Command began as Sea Training Unit (STU) in 1993 and was subsequently renamed Naval Doctrine and Assessment Centre (NDAC) on 7          Feb 12 before its upgrade. Prior to its upgrade to a Command, the defunct units operated under a unique organisational structure, which is at Directorate level. NAVDOC is tasked with formulation of doctrinal values which are critical to the operational and organisational objectives towards enhanced professionalism in the NN.  2.	The Command has been able to deliver considerably in some areas of its mandate such as human capacity development, infrastructural development and supporting the fleet renewal effort of the NN in line with the CNS Strategic Directives. Since the establishment of NAVDOC, efforts have been made to lay a solid foundation for optimal performance of its operational and administrative tasks. As such, the Command continued to execute its expanded statutory roles and other assigned tasks towards enhancing the operational efficiency of the NN.  FUNCTIONS OF NAVAL DOCTRINE COMMAND 3.	The Command is a response to NN’s need for an enduring organisation to formulate and oversee careful implementation of concepts, principles, practices, techniques and procedures of naval operations, consistent with the NN Doctrine. The Command achieves this through actualization of several important functions, which include development of doctrines, conduct of work-up of NN fleet and acceptance trials of new acquisitions which aims at blending the ships' company and the equipment into an efficient and effective fighting unit as well as supporting fleet renewal efforts of the NN. The aspect of work-up was always realized through some forms of training that include: Safety Operational Sea Training (SOST), Basic Operational Sea Training (BOST) and Consolidated Operational Sea Training (COST), which involve the use of NN Evaluation Checklists before the conduct of drills, exercises and evolutions.  NOTABLE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE COMMAND  4.	The Command’s major activities cover training of its personnel which is aimed at enhancing professional capacity towards accomplishment of assigned tasks, assessment of the conduct of Exercises such as OBANGAME EXPRESS,  REMEX, CNS Sea Exercise among others. The Command has successfully conducted Command Appointment Examination (CAPEX) and Midshipman Board for Regular Combatant Cadets before commissioning. Furthermore, the Command has carried out curriculum review of NN professional schools and colleges in as well as conduct of the Higher Rates Professional Advancement Examinations for junior and senior rates amongst others. FLAG OFFICERS COMMANDING 5.	NAVDOC has so far been commanded by 2 Flag Officers Commanding, they are: a.	Rear Admiral AN Ayafa ( Jan 22 – Jun 23)  b.	Rear Admiral HD Zakaria (Jun 23 till date) "
